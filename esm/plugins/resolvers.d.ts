/** this submodule contains a namespaced esbuild plugin that resolves paths based on the three strategies:
 * _runtime-package_ resolution, _import-map_ resolution, and _absolute-path_ resolution.
 *
 * > [!note]
 * > the default namespace you should use in your plugins to call this pipeline of resolvers is {@link PLUGIN_NAMESPACE.RESOLVER_PIPELINE}.
 * > otherwise, if you want, you can customize the namespace of this plugin by specifying it in the `config.namespace` option.
 *
 * below is a summary what the path resolution procedure of this plugin entails, given a certain esbuild input {@link OnResolveArgs | `args`}:
 * 1. first, if {@link RuntimePackage | `args.pluginData.runtimePackage`} exists,
 *    then the plugin tries to resolve the input `args.path` through the use of the {@link RuntimePackage.resolveImport} method.
 *    - if it succeeds (i.e. `args.path` was an alias/import-map specified in the package file),
 *      then the resolved path, along with the original `args.pluginData`, is returned.
 *    - otherwise, if it fails, then the next path resolution takes place (import-map).
 * 2. next, if either {@link ImportMap | `args.pluginData.importMap`} exists,
 *    or {@link ImportMapResolverConfig.globalImportMap | `config.importMap.globalImportMap`} exists,
 *    then the plugin will try to resolve the input `args.path` with respect to these import-maps,
 *    through the use of the {@link resolvePathFromImportMap} function.
 *    - if it succeeds (i.e. `args.path` was part of the import-map(s)),
 *      then the resolved path, along with the original `args.pluginData`, is returned.
 *    - otherwise, if it fails, then the next path resolution will take place (node-modules).
 * 3. up ahead, we let esbuild's native resolver give a shot at resolving `args.path` as a node-module package,
 *    if and only if the path is neither a relative path (i.e. doesn't begin with `"./"` or `"../"`),
 *    nor is it an absolute path (such as "http://example.com/...", or "C:/users/...").
 *    this is because these scenarios can be handled much quicker by the next path-resolver that follows this one
 *    (since that one does not perform filesystem read/scan operations, unlike esbuild's native resolver).
 *    - if it succeeds (i.e. `args.path` was indeed some package inside some `"./node_modules/"` folder up the directory tree),
 *      then the resolved absolute filesystem path of the resource will be returned.
 *    - otherwise, if it fails, then the next path resolution will take place (path-joining).
 *    > [!tip]
 *    > under the hood, this function uses the {@link nodeModulesResolverFactory} function that initializes a mock build process,
 *    > which lets us indirectly query esbuild for the resolved path to the resource (if any).
 * 4. finally, when all else has failed and we've made it to here, and `args.path` is a relative path:
 *    - then we'll simply compute the absolute path of the input `args.path` by combining it with `args.importer`, and `args.resolveDir`.
 *      - if neither of those two arguments are non-empty strings, then we will resort to using esbuild's `absWorkingDir` build option.
 *      - if `absWorkingDir` was itself not specified, then we will fallback to the runtime's current-working-directory as the base directory of `args.path`.
 *    - and again, the original `args.pluginData` is returned along with the result, so that the child dependnecies can inherit it.
